# Utils
Various programs to simplify, automate, and practice coding.

## Content
I update this repo on a weekly basis and use these functions myself. 

Things users can do with this repo:

* [Remove duplicated images](https://github.com/UkrainianProgrammer/Utils/blob/main/src/removeDupImages.py): delete copies of the same image across multiple sub-directories.
* [Convert Word to PDF](https://github.com/UkrainianProgrammer/Utils/blob/main/src/wordToPdf.py): Got tired of googling online document coverter so quickly wrote my own.
